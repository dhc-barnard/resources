# A Resource Hub
The Digital Humanities Center at Barnard is a community space for working critically and creatively with digital technologies. In hosting hands-on workshops, we have created resources that we are sharing publicly in hopes that they may be helpful for students looking to explore with different digital humanities tools.

The resource hub site resulting from this repository can be found at: https://dhc-barnard.github.io/resources/
